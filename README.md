# CRM-App

#### Android version of CS401_CRM extracted to a separate repository

## Description
This app is constructed from the work performed by my team in the first two sprints of my CS401 Software Engineering course. Where I made edits to make their code work in an Android application, I noted that I modified their work in the comments.

The features of this CRM App include:
+ Add an account with a name, account value, close date, and contacts list
+ Add contacts to an account, with name, email, and phone number
+ View accounts in a list, with each account clickable to view details
+ While viewing an account, contacts are viewable in a list, with each contact clickable to view details

This project makes use of Activities, Fragments, and RecyclerViews. Data persistence was not implemented, but could easily be added.
